## How to run Backend
- Install Gradle
- Make sure the environment variable JAVA_HOME contains the directory in which your JDK installation is located
- Open a terminal in the WheelyCleanBackend folder
- Enter the command "run.bat". It will build and run the backend server on port 8080. You can check that the server has started correctly by heading to localhost:8080/greeting
